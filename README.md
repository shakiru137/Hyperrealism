1️⃣ **Create an account** at [fal.ai](https://fal.ai)  
2️⃣ **Login and select Flux** for image generation  
3️⃣ **Try the following prompts** and click "Run"  

💡 **Prompt 1:**  
*"An up-close image of a young, fair-skinned African person giving an animated talk about artificial intelligence. The person is dressed in a black t-shirt with the words ‘ALX AI’ clearly printed on it. They are holding a microphone in one hand, speaking expressively with a look of excitement and enthusiasm. The background features the text ‘ALX AI’ in large, bold letters, subtly blurred to keep the focus on the speaker. The scene is well-lit, highlighting the person’s dynamic gestures and the energy they bring to the topic of artificial intelligence. The overall scene is vibrant and dynamic, capturing the energy of a live presentation."*  

💡 **Prompt 2:**  
*"A realistic portrait of a person with a calm expression, featuring detailed facial features, soft lighting that highlights the contours of the face, and a neutral background that subtly fades into the distance. The person is dressed in casual yet elegant clothing, with natural hair styled neatly. The overall mood of the portrait is serene and introspective, capturing a moment of quiet reflection."*  

💡 **Prompt 3:**  
*"A close-up image of a person intently observing a hummingbird as it sips nectar from a vibrant flower. The person’s face shows a sense of awe and fascination, with their eyes focused on the delicate hummingbird. The hummingbird is captured in mid-flight, its wings a blur of motion, hovering near the flower with intricate details of the petals visible. The background is softly blurred, allowing the viewer to focus on the intimate interaction between the person and the hummingbird, with natural, soft lighting enhancing the scene."*
